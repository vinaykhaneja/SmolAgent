# Demonstrated Agent Functionality

## First Example :
```Query : Open Microsoft Paint, then draw a rectangle from (1560, 950) to (2160, 1350), and finally, Find the sum of exponentials of ASCII values of characters in 'INDIA' and write the returned value as text at position (1560, 950).```

### 1\. **Drawing a Rectangle in Microsoft Paint & Writing Exponential Sum of ASCII Values**

-   **Task Description**:
    
    -   Open Microsoft Paint.
        
    -   Draw a rectangle from the coordinates (1560, 950) to (2160, 1350).
        
    -   Compute the sum of exponentials of ASCII values of characters in the string "INDIA".
        
    -   Display the result as text at position (1560, 950) in Microsoft Paint.
        

## Second Example :
```Query : Generate an email to send to vinaysupermario@gmail.com, requesting an extension for the Session-2 quiz deadline. Mention that I, Vinay, missed the quiz, have not attempted it, and cannot view the post-attempt content. Ask if it would be possible for me to take the quiz at a later date. The email should have an appropriate subject line and be written in a polite and professional tone. Address the professor as 'Rohan' and sign off as 'Vinay'.```

### 2\. **Sending an Email Request for Quiz Deadline Extension**

-   **Task Description**:
    
    -   Compose an email to **vinaysupermario@gmail.com**.
        
    -   The email requests an extension for the Session-2 quiz deadline.
        
    -   Mention that the sender, **Vinay**, missed the quiz, has not attempted it, and cannot view the post-attempt content.
        
    -   Politely ask if it is possible to take the quiz at a later date.
        
    -   The email should be addressed to **Rohan** (the professor).
        
    -   End the email with the sender's name, **Vinay**.
        
    -   The email should have a professional and respectful tone.
        

### How It Works:

-   The agent can interact with specific applications (like Microsoft Paint) and generate emails based on structured input.
    
-   For the Microsoft Paint task, the agent opens the program, performs drawing actions, and inputs text at a given location.
    
-   For the email task, the agent generates a well-crafted email following user input and sends it to the specified recipient.
